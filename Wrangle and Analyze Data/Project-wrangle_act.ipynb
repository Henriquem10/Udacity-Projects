    "* You only want original ratings (no retweets) that have images. Though there are 5000+ tweets in the dataset, not all are dog ratings and some are retweets.\n",
    "* Assessing and cleaning the entire dataset completely would require a lot of time, and is not necessary to practice and demonstrate your skills in data wrangling. Therefore, the requirements of this project are only to assess and clean at least 8 quality issues and at least 2 tidiness issues in this dataset.\n",
    "* The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This [unique rating system](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent) is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.\n",
    "* You do not need to gather the tweets beyond August 1st, 2017. You can, but note that you won't be able to gather the image predictions for these tweets since you don't have access to the algorithm used.\n",
