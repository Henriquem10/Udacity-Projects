The dataset is the Ford GoBike System Data sugested by the course.
Some of the wrangling steps realized in this dataset was the change of type of some columns such as the gender, the ids and the start and end time. A new column was also added using the lagitude and longitude to make a distance column.
A new column was also made to make it easier to look at the stations names

## Summary of Findings

>The majority of the users are male and the minority the 'Other' gender option, with females being in the middle
>There are way more users that are subscribed to the service
>most users don't seem to use the bike share function
>Thursday and Tuesday are the most popular days of the service
>Market St and San Francisco Caltrain Station 2 are the most popular stations that the service is used
>Users that are customers have a higher average time per run
>females appear to run longer than males. But users with the 'Other' as gender run even longer than both of then 
>The runs are longer on the weekends even though the weekend are the days with less users than the others
>Most of the runs have a distance between 1 and 2 km but these distances can't be taken at face value because it's only the information of the start and finish and not the route.
>everyday the 'other' gender type is the one with the most time in seconds followed by females.
>even though the weekends have more time in seconds on rides, it makes sense that it has less distance in total then others because it has less users in total using the service
>Even though the service has less users during the weekends, those users are the ones that have the longest time using it. Maybe thats why it has less users using?


## Key Insights for Presentation

>
The fact that on saturday and sunday the service has more time being used but are the days that has the least amount of users. The fact that the users with 'Other' as gender are the most active users is also worth mentioning.
